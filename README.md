### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer & UI designer. I love making applications that are easy and enjoyable to use.  
I'm mostly experienced in `C#/.NET`, `WPF` and related technologies. I also enjoy developing `cloud-native` applications.

I currently work at ALTEX-SOFT as a Chief of Security Audit Software Development.

In my spare time, I'm developing and maintaining a number of projects, including open-source.

I'm currently learning `GitHub Actions`.
