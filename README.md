### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Pavel, I'm a Software Engineer with strong UI/UX background. I love making apps with a user-friendly and well-designed interface.
I also enjoy developing cloud-native apps, bots, APIs and things like that.

I currently work at ALTEX-SOFT as a Chief of Security Audit Software Development.

In my spare time, I'm developing and maintaining a number of projects, including open-source.
